# 🔊 Gunshot Detection & Localization System (MATLAB)

This project detects and localizes gunshots using two-microphone audio recordings in MATLAB. It calculates the **Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)** and estimates the **Angle of Arrival (AoA)** to determine the direction from which a gunshot sound originated.

---

## 📌 Features

- Gunshot detection using amplitude threshold
- Time of Arrival (ToA) & Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation
- Angle of Arrival calculation using trigonometry
- Direction classification (Front, Left, Right, Back, etc.)
- Audio playback & polar plot visualization for direction
